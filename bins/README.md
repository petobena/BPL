# **Note: ALL BPL settings will be gone after upgrading to v3.0**

# Prebuilt Image

NOTE: If you are upgrading from version prior to v2.3 without glycol option, you will need to run "Device Setup" again. Erase the EEPROM, setup the sensors, and the PINs.


NOTE: The images with **newui** use different flash layout(4m2m) which has 2m file space. They are not "compatible" with those(4m) have 3m file space.  
 * Online update might not work on changing between those two layout. Flashing by USB is recommended.
 * File system will be reformted after changing. All settings will be gone

NOTE: Due to the size increase of latest framework, all images will use 2m file space after version 3.6. The last version for 4m1m and SONOFF is v3.5.1.
